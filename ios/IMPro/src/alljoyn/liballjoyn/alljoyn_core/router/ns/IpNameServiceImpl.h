/**
 * @brief API to provide an implementation dependent IP (Layer 3) Name Service
 * for AllJoyn.
 *
 * The basic goal of this class is to provide a way for AllJoyn daemons, clients
 * and services to find an IP address and socket to use when connecting to
 * other daemons, clients and services.
 *
 * To first approximation, what we want is to allow a user of AllJoyn to search
 * for IP addresses and ports of daemons that provide some AllJoyn service, as
 * defined by a well-known or bus name.
 *
 * For example, a client may come up and ask, "where is an AllJoyn daemon that
 * implements the org.freedesktop.yadda bus name?  The name service may
 * respond, for example, "one is at IP address 10.0.0.1, listening on port
 * 9955 and another is at IP address 10.0.0.2, listening on port 9955".  The
 * client can then do a TCP connect to one of those addresses and ports.

    /**
     * @brief Notify the name service that that there is or is not a listener on
     *     the specified endpoints.
     *
     * The IpNameService is shared among several transports.  In order to
     * advertise the presence of a network endpoint managed by a transport, the
     * transports need to advise us of the IP addresses and ports on which it
     * can be contacted.  Each transport may use a different set of addresses
     * and ports, and so each transport must identify itself to the name
     * service.  This is done using the TransportMask.  There is a bit in the
     * TransportMask for each transport in the system.
     *
     * A transport is defined as a module that provides reliable and/or
     * unreliable data transfer over IPv4 and/or IPv6.  Support for reliable and
     * unreliable modes is optional, as is support for IPv4 and IPv6.  Port
     * numbers for reliable, unreliable, IPv4 and IPv6 may also differ.  An
     * enable bit is conceptually required since support for each endpoint type
     * is optional.  This makes for thirteen parameters.
     *
     *     transportMask,
     *     enableReliableIPv4, reliableIPv4Addr, reliableIPv4Port
     *     enableReliableIPv6, reliableIPv6Addr, reliableIPv6Port
     *     enableUnreliableIPv4, unreliableIPv4Addr, unreliableIPv4Port
     *     enableUnReliableIPv6, unreliableIPv6Addr, unreliableIPv6Port
     *
     * It turns out that since AllJoyn lives in a mobile environment, the
     * transport must listen on the "any" address.  This is because an IP
     * address assigned to a given network interface cannot generally be
     * predicted in advance.
     *
     * The mechanism used to "control" which network interfaces can accept
     * incoming connections, is the presence of outgoing advertisements on those
     * interfaces.  If a transport desires to accept connections over an
     * interface, it performs an OpenInterface() on that interface which begins
     * the process of sending advertisements.  The IP (V4 and or V6) address of
     * the interface is added to advertisements and sent out over the network.
     * This which provides the receiver of the advertisements with an IP address
     * and port to connect to.  The advertising transport, since it is listening
     * on the "any" address, will respond to all connect requests coming from
     * clients on the associated network.  If the transport wants to filter
     * further on source IP addresses, it certainly can; but this is not a
     * concern of the name service.
     *
     * This all means that we do not need to specify the IP addresses on which
     * the reliable and unreliable protocols are listening. This means that
     * there are nine required parameters to this call instead of thirteen:
     *
     *     transportMask,
     *     reliableIPv4Port, reliableIPv6Port,
     *     unreliableIPv4Port, unreliableIPv6Port,
     *     enableReliableIPv4, enableReliableIPv6,
     *     enableUnreliableIPv4, enableUnreliableIPv6
     *
     * In many cases, the transports will not support all combinations.  For
     * example, the tcp transport currently only supports reliable IPv4
     * connections, and so the call for this transport might be:
     *
     *     Enable(TRANSPORT_TCP, 9955, 0, 0, 0, true, false, false, false);
     *
     * The Android Compatibility Test Suite demands that an Android phone may
     * not hold an open socket in the quiescent state.  Since we provide a
     * native daemon that always runs on the phone, and the daemon has
     * transports that want to listen on sockets, there must be a way to close
     * those sockets (and the multicast sockets in the name service) and not
     * use them at all when there are no advertisements or discovery operations
     * in progress.  This also helps with power consumption.
     *
     * Enable() communicates the fact that there is or is not a listener for the
     * specified transport port and this, in turn, implies whether or not
     * advertisements should be sent and received over the interfaces opened by
     * the given transport.

     * @brief Set the Callback for notification of discovery events.
     *
     * When using an asynchronous service discovery process, a caller will
     * need to specify how to called back when a service appears, disappears
     * or reaffirms its existence on the network.  This method provides the
     * mechanism for specifying the callback.
     *
     * The method signature for the Callback method must be:
     *
     * @code
     *     void Found(const qcc::String &, const qcc::String &, std::vector<qcc::String> &, uint32_t);
     * @endcode
     *
     * The first parameter is the address and port of the found service,
     * formatted as a bus address the way AllJoyn likes, for example,
     * "tcp:addr=192.168.0.1,port=9955".  The second parameter is the daemon
     * guid string exported by the remote daemon service, or the empty string
     * if that daemon didn't bother to export the string.  The third parameter
     * is a vector of qcc::String that represent the well-known names that the
     * remote daemon is referring to, for example, "org.freedesktop.Yadda".
     * The fourth parameter is the timer value.  A timer value of zero indicates
     * that the names provided in the vectoror qcc::String are no longer
     * available.  A timer value of 255 indicates that the names provided should
     * be interpreted as always available, to the extent that is possible.
     * A timer value between 0 and 255 indicates the number of seconds that the
     * name is expected to be valid.  There will be keepalive messages provided
     * which may extend this time periodically.
     *
     * The typical idiom for using the callback facility is to define a method
     * to receive a found callback in your class and instantiate your class
     * (and this one) somewhere:
     *
     * @code
     *     class MyClass:
     *     public:
     *         void Found(const qcc::String &s, const qcc::String &g, std::vector<qcc::String>& wkn, uint32_t timer) {}
     *     }
     *
     *     ...
     *
     *     MyClass myClass;
     *     IpNameServiceImpl nameService;
     * @endcode
     *
     * The callback is connected using the SetCallback() method of this
     * class.
     *
     * @code
     *    nameService.SetCallback(new CallbackImpl<MyClass, void,
     *         const qcc::String &, const qcc::String &, std::vector<qcc::string>, uint32_t>(MyClass, myclass));
     * @endcode
     *
     * From this point forward, all changes to services specified by the
     * Locate() call will be set to you through the callback mechanism.
     *
     * To stop notifications, set the callback (cb) to the pointer value 0.
     *
     * @warning The callback will be in the context of a different thread than
     * your thread, so your Found callback code must be multithread safe (or aware
     * at least).
     *
     * @warning Services may come and go constantly during real network operation.
     * Just because a service was found on the network it does not mean that there
     * will be a service waiting on the provided IP address and port.  This
     * service may be gone by the time you connect; and this is a perfectly
     * legal and reasonable situation.
     *
     * @param[in] cb the Callback pointer.
     *
     * @return Status of the operation.  Returns ER_OK on success.
